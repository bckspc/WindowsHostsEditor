WindowsHostsEditor
==================

A program made in .NET to edit the windows host editor.

This program provides a GUI to edit the windows hosts file (default is in: %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts).
Since MS Windows only allows file associations by extentions and the hosts file has none, the only way you normally have to edit the hosts file is to have a shortcut with notepad.exe and the hosts file as an argument or to go directly to the folder of the hosts file and right-click->Open With...
Besides this, you need to edit this file as an Administrator if your UAC is not disabled so, common shortcuts in the context menu (like 'Edit with Notepad++', etc.) will not work.

This program aims to ease all the changes made to the hosts file and helping validate invalid or duplicate entries.

This is a simple and for some useless tool but very usefull in my line of work

Enjoy! :)
